I am working on my PhD project in Speech Recognition, contextualisation, and customisation. 

My Research Interests:
- Audio and Speech Signal Processing
- Machine Learning and Deep Learning
- Contextual adaptation and Customisation
- ASR for assisting Air-Traffic communication

You can find my CV: <a href="https://github.com/yunigma/yunigma.github.io/blob/master/docs/CV_jul_github.pdf">here</a> (last update: September 2024)

Since a long time I am interested in spontaneous speech phenomena, speech analysis and speech technologies with the focus on speech recognition. I worked as a research assistant at the University of Saint-Petersburg (Speech Modelling laboratory), later at the University of Zurich (Phonetics laboratory); read courses “Introduction in general Phonetics” and “Methods of speech analysis” (Saint Petersburg State University of Aerospace and Instrumentation); did internships at SpinningBytes AG (NLP; Zurich) and Idiap (Speech and Audio Processing group; Martigny).

Now I am a PhD student at the University of Zurich and work as research assistant in the "Speech and Audio Processing'' group at Idiap. I work on the improvement of ASR with contextual data (keywords, knowledge from the previous and current context) and biasing technologies in ASR bridging ASR and NLP.
